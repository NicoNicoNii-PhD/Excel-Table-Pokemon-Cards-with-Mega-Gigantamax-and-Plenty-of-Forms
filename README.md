Nothing too elaborate. I wanted to track what cards I have and what not in obsidian. I wanted to cover as many possible cards as possible. It is obviously not complete, but I hope that this project can help someone else who wants to do the same thing. 
I added the csv file and json, so anyone should be able to refine as needed.
